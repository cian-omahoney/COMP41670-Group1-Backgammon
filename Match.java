/**
 * Class representing a match which ends with one player bearing all checkers off the board,
 * or with one player refusing a double.  Multiple matches can make up a game.
 *
 * Design Pattern: This class is implemented similar to a Facade deign pattern.
 *                 A Facade pattern provides a unified interface to a set of interfaces
 *                 in a subsystem, in this case to the board, points, players and UI.
